==============================================

Participants:
+--------+        +--------+        +--------+
| Maker  |<-----> | Escrow |<-----> | Taker  |
+--------+        +--------+        +--------+

Flow:
1. Maker deploys contract, locking TRX, setting hashlock & timelock
2. Taker can withdraw by revealing the correct secret before timelock
3. If timelock expires, Maker can cancel and reclaim funds

Key Variables:
- maker:    address of escrow creator
- taker:    address allowed to withdraw
- hashlock: keccak256(secret)
- timelock: unix timestamp for cancellation
- amount:   TRX locked in contract
- withdrawn/cancelled: state flags

Key Security:
- Only taker can withdraw (with secret)
- Only maker can cancel (after timelock)
- Funds can only be moved once (withdrawn/cancelled)

Events:
- EscrowCreated
- EscrowWithdrawn
- EscrowCancelled

State Transitions:
[Created] --withdraw(secret)--> [Withdrawn]
[Created] --cancel(after timelock)--> [Cancelled]
